# tints
**tints** is a progressive web-application that can input a reference image of a person to extract the cosmetic color of the three parts in the picture, which are lips, cheeks, and skin using color extraction, image processing techniques for face detection.  
Since each person has different skin tones, the application will suggest the product based on suitable colors for each user. The application can also simulate the color of cosmetics to the user image
